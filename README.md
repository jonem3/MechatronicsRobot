## Description:
This project is our second year Mechatronics project, in this poroject we were tasked with designing and manufacturing a mobile manipulator robot similar to what would be found in a factory buy on a smaller scale. 

## Task:
### Task 1
For this task we were required to only be using our robotic arm as assembled within the Semester 1 Mechatronics labs to draw a line on a whiteboard, for this we had to assemble an end effector for the robot capable of holding a pen and then use 2 degree of freedom inverse kinematics to determine the correct input to the arm for this task

### Task 2
For this task we were requried to use the mobile robot to drive around an arena passing through a variety of obstacles, this included designing a line following sensor array from available parts within the lab shop.

### Task 3
This taks was a combination of Tasks 1 and 2, in this task we were requried to drive around the arena with a stop at the whiteboard in the middle of the loop to draw a cross on the board
